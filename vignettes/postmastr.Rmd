`postmastr` is designed to be an *opinionated* toolkit for parsing street addresses using `R`. It was originally created to standardize addresses prior to geocoding the, in an effor to increase the geocoder's ability to correctly match a given address with the appropriate coordinates.

## Motivation
Street addresses can be notoriously difficult to work with. In the United States, the U.S. Postal Service has [standards for their composition](https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/welcome.htm). There is so much variety, however, that anticipating all of the possible permutations of addresses is a significant task. When the inaccuracy of human data entry is added, the challenge of parsing addresses becomes monumental. The goal of `postmastr` is to provide a uniform workflow for parsing street address data that allows for sufficient flexibility. 

This flexibility is provided in two ways. First, we utilize "dictionaries" for a number of the key functions that allow users to provide vectors of data to base parsing on. This enables `postmastr` to parse potential misspellings and colloquial terms that are hard (or impossible) to predict. Second, not all aspects of the workflow are mandatory - if street address data do not contain postal codes, states, or cities, for example, those functions can be skipped.

## Getting Help
* If you are new to `R` itself, welcome! Hadley Wickham's [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) is an excellent way to get started with data manipulation in the tidyverse, which `stlcsb` is designed to integrate seamlessly with.
* If you have questions about using `postmastr`, you are encouraged to use the [RStudio Community forums](https://community.rstudio.com). Please create a [`reprex`](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before posting. Feel free to tag Chris (`@chris.prener`) in any posts about `postmastr`.
* If you think you've found a bug, please create a [`reprex`](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) and then open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/stlcsb/issues/new/choose).
