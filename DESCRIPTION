Title: Tidy Tools for Standardizing and Parsing Street Addresses

Description: The goal of postmastr is to provide consistent, tidy parsing of street address data. 
    The package is primarily oriented towards American-style street addresses, e.g. "123 East Main Street". 
    It contains functions for both standardizing address elements (e.g. converting street names like 
    "Second" to "2nd" or converting "AV" to "Ave") and for parsing out intput strings into separate 
    variables for each input element. Functionality is also provided to re-build parsed street addresses
    into a single string.
